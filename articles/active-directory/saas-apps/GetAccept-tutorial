In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate GetAccept with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

When you integrate GetAccept with Azure AD, you can:

Control in Azure AD who has access to GetAccept.
Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to GetAccept with their Azure AD accounts.
Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.
Adding GetAccept to your Azure applications
Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
On the left navigation pane, select the Azure Active Directory service.
Navigate to Enterprise Applications and then click New application in the top
Select Non-gallery application
Enter GetAccept as name on the right pane and click Add.
Enable GetAccept SSO
Follow these steps to enable GetAccept SSO support.

Login to GetAccept, and go to Settings, Integrations, Provisioning and SSO
Click Connect next to SAML Authentication
Keep this browser tab open for easy access of settings in later steps
Configure Azure AD SSO
Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

In the Azure portal, on the GetAccept application integration page, find the Manage section and select single sign-on.
On the Select a single sign-on method page, select SAML.
Click the edit/pen icon for Basic SAML Configuration to edit the settings.
Copy/paste values from the SAML Authentication page in GetAccept. See mapping below.

Assign the Azure AD test user
In the Azure portal, select Enterprise Applications, and then select All applications.

In the app's overview page, find the Manage section and select Users and groups.
Select Add user, then select Users and groups in the Add Assignment dialog.
In the Users and groups dialog, select yourself from the Users list, then click the Select button at the bottom of the screen.

Validate and save AD SSO
Make sure that the current logged in AD administrator also is a user in GetAccept using the same email address. Also logout from GetAccept before validating to make sure the integration is working.

Click Validate at the bottom
Select Sign in as current user
Wait a few seconds and verify the logged in user inside GetAccept at the lower left corner. Got it working? Yay!

Adding the GetAccept logo to the app
We recommend that you enable the application to all users and also upload the GetAccept logo. 

Download the GetAccept logo below by right-clicking and saving the logo.
In the app's overview page, find the Manage section and select Properties.
Upload the png-file under Logo.
Click Save at the top.

Test SSO
Test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the GetAccept tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the GetAccept for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see Introduction to the Access Panel.
